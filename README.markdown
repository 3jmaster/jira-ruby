Jira 5 API Gem

Proper documentation to come.

Configuring JIRA to use OAuth
-----------------------------
From the Jira API tutorial

> The first step is to register a new consumer in JIRA. This is done through 
> the Application Links administration screens in JIRA. Create a new Application Link. 
> 
> When creating the Application Link use a placeholder URL or the correct URL to 
> your client, if your client can be reached via HTTP and choose the Generic Application
> type. After this Application Link has been created, edit the configuration and go to
> the incoming authentication configuration screen and select OAuth. Enter in this the
> public key and the consumer key which your client will use when making requests to JIRA.

This public key and consumer key will need to be generated by the Gem user, using OpenSSL 
or similar to generate the public key and the provided rake task to generate the consumer 
key.

> After you have entered all the information click OK and ensure OAuth authentication is
> enabled.
